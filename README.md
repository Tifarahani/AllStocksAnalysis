## Challange 2-Bootcamp


## Overview of Project
>The purpose of this project was to refactor a Stock Market Dataset with VBA and demonstrate "Total Daily Volume" and "Return" in the year 2017 and 2018 using 
> knowlde of Arrays,For loops, Formatting Cells to know if the Market is good to invest in or not.

## Results


 - Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

### What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
- [x] Advantages:
* After refactoring, the code is fresher, easier to understand or read, less complex and easier to maintain
* Logical errors easily appear in well structure code that contains nested conditionals and loops.
* It prevents many future defects. 
* Code Size is reduced. 
* Confused coding is properly restructured.
* Will lead to more unit testable code 
- [x] Disadvantages:
- Time consuming
- A long procedure may contain the same line of code in several locations, you can change the logic to eliminate the duplicate lines.
-A logical structure may be duplicated in two or more procedures (possibly via copy & paste coding). When detected, this logic is best moved to a new function and called from the other functions.
-Refactoring process can affect the testing outcomes.

### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script
- [x] Pros: Refactoring leads to better quality code
- [x] Cons: We have to retest lots of functionality and it takes a lot of time

##  Conclusion:Refactoring improves the design of software, makes software easier to understand, helps us find bugs and also helps in executing the program faster. There is an additional benefit of refactoring. It changes the way a developer thinks about the implementation when not refactoring.
