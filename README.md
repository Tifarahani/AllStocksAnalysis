## Challange 2-Bootcamp


## Overview of Project
>The purpose of this project was to refactor a Stock Market Dataset with VBA and demonstrate "Total Daily Volume" and "Return" in the year 2017 and 2018 using 
> knowlde of Arrays,For loops, Formatting Cells to know if the Market is good to invest in or not.

##  Summary:

### What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
- [x] Advantages:
* After refactoring, the code is fresher, easier to understand or read, less complex and easier to maintain
* Logical errors easily appear in well structure code that contains nested conditionals and loops.
* It prevents many future defects. 
* Code Size is reduced. 
* Confused coding is properly restructured.
* Will lead to more unit testable code 
- [x] Disadvantages:
- Time consuming
- A long procedure may contain the same line of code in several locations, you can change the logic to eliminate the duplicate lines.
-A logical structure may be duplicated in two or more procedures (possibly via copy & paste coding). When detected, this logic is best moved to a new function and called from the other functions.
-Refactoring process can affect the testing outcomes.

### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script
- [x] Pros: Refactoring leads to better quality code
- [x] Cons: We have to retest lots of functionality and it takes a lot of time

#### Conclusion: 
Refactoring improves the design of software, makes software easier to understand, helps us find bugs and also helps in executing the program faster.
